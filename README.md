# Instagram-Media
JSON parser to grab media files from Instagram without going through the API.

Instagram's API has gotten progessively more closed over the past couple years.
At the time of this writing, you must request special access to interact with even
public objects - this is a long process and supposedly they deny many people.

This script uses a <i>hardcoded</i> url, as this is the only URL that I know of
that returns JSON data about an instagram user's page.
